--[[
67) Go back down to the Warp fields around 50,83 and get an uncontrolled voidwalker to about 25% life and
use the crystal on it and grab the red crystal it drops for "An Ambitious Plan" then head to the east
towards Zeth’Gor at 67,75
68) Go up into Zeth’Gor to the east at 64,74 and kill the Grunts, Necrolytes, and shamans for "Cursed
Talismans" I hit the 25% through 61 mark while doing this. Kinda bad drop rate but a good grind spot
while doing a quest.
57) Once you’re done turn it back in at Expedition point to the NE at 70,63 accept "Warlord of the Bleeding
Hollow"
58) Go back up into Zeth'Gor to the back into the big building at 69,76 and go to the center and kill Warlord
Morkh for "Warlord of the Bleeding Hollow" then go back to Expedition Point at 70,63 and turn it in.
59) Unfortunately that quest chain ends there, but it’s a good xp grind getting the talismans, even though you
lose 250 rep for doing it, at least in beta so it may be a bug.
60) Now either hearth to Telhamat if your hearth is up, or get on the gryphon to shattered point then fly to
the Temple and run into the Inn, turn in "An Ambitious Plan"
61) Start using the lfg tool and chat to look for a group for Hellfire Citadel Ramparts for that quest you picked
up earlier. Plus they designed outlands as I explained, to make you do instances, or else you’re gonna hit
63 ½ or so and get stuck grinding or instancing them. Try to do HFC before you leave town here for
quests. You could grind instead if you want
62) Vazruden, the guy who gets off the last dragon, in ramparts will drop a letter called Ominous Letter which
starts "Dark Tidings"
63) Go back into HH up in the main castle and turn in "Weaken the Ramparts" accept "Heart of Rage" and
"The Blood is Life" then turn in "Dark Tidings" you should now be close to 50% to 62.
64) Now you can either go and do the Blood Furnace (which is easier than ramparts) or you can finish up the
rest of HFP before you attempt it. I say do it later if you want because running 2 instances can suck, but
as you seen ramparts was pretty short
65) Enter the wall on the West side of HFC, there are some stairs at 45,58 and follow it up to the entrance
66) The blood is very easy to get and the investigation is complete when you enter that bottom circle at the
end. Take a look below you too, to see a huge demon for the shattered halls. He’s who keeps talking.
67) Now leave by the green tunnel and run back to HH, to the big castle up top and turn in "Heart of Rage" to
Danath Trollbane, then turn in "The Blood is Life" to Gunny.
68) From Telhamat run down SW to Cenarion Post at 15,52 and accept "The Cenarion Expedition" "Keep
Thornpoint Hill Clear!" and turn in "Helping the Cenarion Post" to Thiah Redmane and accept "Demonic
Contamination" SKIP "Colossal Menace" unless you want to do it with a group
69) Go east of here and start killing Hulking Helboars. There all around HFP but there is a lot to the east. Once
you're done head back West to Cenarion Post and turn it in then accept "Testing the Antidote" then go
back east, find a helboar and use the antidote on him and he’ll turn into dreadtusk, just kill him then go
back and turn it in
70) Go just west now to Thornpoint Hill and start killing ravagers for "Keep Thornpoint Hill Clear!" make sure
you're at full health before each one. They have some wierd thorn protection and seem to break stuns
early. Go back to Cenarion Point and turn it in
71) Now overall you should be at least 90% through 61 if you’re not already 62 which you should be after
grinding or doing HFC.
72) You’ll want to go back to SW to get your new skills. Make sure you go before you head to Zangarmarsh
because there is no flightpath right at the start of this zone. Once you’re done with your skills, hearth to
Telhamat
73) Run all the way west, through the ravagers, into Zangarmarsh
