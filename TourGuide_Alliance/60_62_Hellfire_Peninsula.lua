48) Go in the SE corner of the camp up the path to a hut at 16,65 and accept "A Traitor Among Us" Now go
back down to the hut at 14,63 and open the chest and grab the key, make sure the 63 elite isn't around
then go back up and turn it in. Accept "The Dreghood Elders" then Go back down and free Morod at 13,60
in the tent, Aylaan in the tent at 13,58 both are on the west side of the ruins. Finally free Akoru at 15,58
in the tent on the east side of the ruins. Go to the tent in the back of the ruins and turn in "The Dreghood
Elders" accept "Arzeth's Demise" Go back down and use the Staff of the Dreghood Elders on the 63 elite to
remove his elite status and kill him, then run back up to tent and turn in "Arzeth's Demise"
49) Go SE to 23,72 turn in "The Longbeards" accept "The Arakkoa Threat" "Rampaging Ravagers" and
"Gaining Mirren's Trust" You should be friendly now and already have the bitter for it, then turn it back in
and accept "The Finest Down"
50) Just NW of the longbeards you'll see a big thorny area full of ravagers, kill 10 quillfang ravagers for
"Rampaging Ravagers" then go back to the Longbeard camp at 23,72 and turn it in
51) Just SE of the longbeard camp is a valley, kill 6 Haal'eshi Talonguards and 4 Windwalkers for "The Arakkoa
Threat" Also look for Kaliri Nests which will spawn a hatchling which drop the feathers for "The Finest
Down" At about 25,76 there is a path above the valley, go up there and kill Avruu and he will drop
“Avruu’s Orb” go farther back, you should see a purple house at 29,81, out front is an orb touch it and a
63 elemental spawns, you have to fight him to 40% life to free him, I think some classes will have trouble
with this, my rogue did just fine, don’t be afraid to try for a group if you can’t do it alone
52) Mount and run back up to the Longbeards camp Turn in "The Finest Down" and "The Arakkoa Threat"
53) Go east of the Haal'eshi valley and you'll see stonescythe whelps and stonescythe alphas. Alphas are more
in higher ground and in the cave at 34,62 for "Deadly Predators"
54) You're gonna exit the Stonescythe area right into the Southern Rampart at 42,68
55) Go down SW from here into Razorthorn Trail at 39,86 and start collecting ravager eggs for "Ravager Egg
Roundup"
56) Go NE to the zeppelin crash site at 49,74 and turn in "Ravager Egg Roundup" accept "Helboar, the Other
White Meat" and turn in "In Case of Emergency..." accept "Voidwalkers Gone Wild"
57) You should be 61 now or really close to it. If you’re not it’s no biggy, theres nothing for a tiny bit that
needs you to be 61
Hellfire Peninsula 61-62
You will find the deranged helboars all around the zeppelin and to the east of the crash site. The creation
of the purified meat is about 50/50. Then go further south of the zeppelin to 47,80 in the warp fields and
kill the voidwalkers. While killing the voidwalkers, go east to the Expedition Armory to 54,83 and kill
Thalvos and to the north a tiny bit to 53,81 and kill Xintor for "Looking to the Leadership" Real easy ones
to kill. Once you have it all, run back up to the zeppelin and turn in "Helboar, the Other White Meat" SKIP
"Smooth as Butter" it’s just too low of a drop rate, then turn in "Voidwalkers Gone Wild"
59) Hearth back to Telhamat
60) Turn in "Sha'naar Relics" accept "The Seer's Relic" and "Helping the Cenarion Post" Turn around and
accept "An Ambitious Plan". Go south of town, turn in "Deadly Predators" and "Cruel Taskmasters"
61) Go east to 26,37 Sedai's Corpse and use the Seer's Relic on it. Then go to the northern part of the Pools
of Aggonar at 40,31 and you will spawn Aggonar, he's 63, kinda rough but not too hard.
62) If you’re racing for time, die so you end up at the temple, otherwise run back
63) Run back up into the Inn, turn in "The Seer's Relic" and "Cleansing the Waters"
64) Fly to HH
65) Leave town by the west entrance and head straight for the tower below and turn in "Looking to the
Leadership"
66) You should be 61 now for sure, you’re probably past 61 a bit at this point
67) Go back down to the Warp fields around 50,83 and get an uncontrolled voidwalker to about 25% life and
use the crystal on it and grab the red crystal it drops for "An Ambitious Plan" then head to the east
towards Zeth’Gor at 67,75
68) Go up into Zeth’Gor to the east at 64,74 and kill the Grunts, Necrolytes, and shamans for "Cursed
Talismans" I hit the 25% through 61 mark while doing this. Kinda bad drop rate but a good grind spot
while doing a quest.
57) Once you’re done turn it back in at Expedition point to the NE at 70,63 accept "Warlord of the Bleeding
Hollow"
58) Go back up into Zeth'Gor to the back into the big building at 69,76 and go to the center and kill Warlord
Morkh for "Warlord of the Bleeding Hollow" then go back to Expedition Point at 70,63 and turn it in.
59) Unfortunately that quest chain ends there, but it’s a good xp grind getting the talismans, even though you
lose 250 rep for doing it, at least in beta so it may be a bug.
60) Now either hearth to Telhamat if your hearth is up, or get on the gryphon to shattered point then fly to
the Temple and run into the Inn, turn in "An Ambitious Plan"
61) Start using the lfg tool and chat to look for a group for Hellfire Citadel Ramparts for that quest you picked
up earlier. Plus they designed outlands as I explained, to make you do instances, or else you’re gonna hit
63 ½ or so and get stuck grinding or instancing them. Try to do HFC before you leave town here for
quests. You could grind instead if you want
62) Vazruden, the guy who gets off the last dragon, in ramparts will drop a letter called Ominous Letter which
starts "Dark Tidings"
63) Go back into HH up in the main castle and turn in "Weaken the Ramparts" accept "Heart of Rage" and
"The Blood is Life" then turn in "Dark Tidings" you should now be close to 50% to 62.
64) Now you can either go and do the Blood Furnace (which is easier than ramparts) or you can finish up the
rest of HFP before you attempt it. I say do it later if you want because running 2 instances can suck, but
as you seen ramparts was pretty short
65) Enter the wall on the West side of HFC, there are some stairs at 45,58 and follow it up to the entrance
66) The blood is very easy to get and the investigation is complete when you enter that bottom circle at the
end. Take a look below you too, to see a huge demon for the shattered halls. He’s who keeps talking.
67) Now leave by the green tunnel and run back to HH, to the big castle up top and turn in "Heart of Rage" to
Danath Trollbane, then turn in "The Blood is Life" to Gunny.
68) From Telhamat run down SW to Cenarion Post at 15,52 and accept "The Cenarion Expedition" "Keep
Thornpoint Hill Clear!" and turn in "Helping the Cenarion Post" to Thiah Redmane and accept "Demonic
Contamination" SKIP "Colossal Menace" unless you want to do it with a group
69) Go east of here and start killing Hulking Helboars. There all around HFP but there is a lot to the east. Once
you're done head back West to Cenarion Post and turn it in then accept "Testing the Antidote" then go
back east, find a helboar and use the antidote on him and he’ll turn into dreadtusk, just kill him then go
back and turn it in
70) Go just west now to Thornpoint Hill and start killing ravagers for "Keep Thornpoint Hill Clear!" make sure
you're at full health before each one. They have some wierd thorn protection and seem to break stuns
early. Go back to Cenarion Point and turn it in
71) Now overall you should be at least 90% through 61 if you’re not already 62 which you should be after
grinding or doing HFC.
72) You’ll want to go back to SW to get your new skills. Make sure you go before you head to Zangarmarsh
because there is no flightpath right at the start of this zone. Once you’re done with your skills, hearth to
Telhamat
73) Run all the way west, through the ravagers, into Zangarmarsh
