TourGuide is an interactive leveling guide addon.
It is designed to provide the user with a streamlined order of quest completion with smart detection.
It is also designed for easy creation of "guides" for users with little-to-no programming knowledge.

h2. Features

* Automatic detection of objective completion
** Detect quest accept, completion and turnin
** Detect travel (by foot, flight, boat and stone)
** Detection of flight point discovery
** Detection of Hearth point change
** Conditionals based on class, level and item possession (only tell the player to accept the quest if they have the item that starts the quest)
* Small "lego block" style frame shows current objective, detailed tooltips on hover
* "Use item" frame, for those annoying quests where you have to use an item on a mob before you kill it, or you have to equip something, or you have to use an item to start a quest
* Pop out frame for detailed view of quest sequence
* Automatic mapping of coordinates with "TomTom":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7032-TomTom.html and questgiver locations from "LightHeaded":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7017-LightHeaded.html if installed
* "LDB":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1/wikis data feed, for those that would rather use a LDB display than the built in "lego"

h2. Notes

Level ranges on the guides are general guidelines only, mainly designed to help you find what guide you should start with for your current level.

TourGuide will use the built-in quest objective map coordinates in most cases.  If you find this is not adequate and you are lost, can check with "LightHeaded":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7017-LightHeaded.html or "Wowhead":http://www.wowhead.com and "submit a bug":http://github.com/tekkub/TourGuide/blob/docs/submitting_bugs.markdown so notes can be added to the objective.

If you wish to use the "use item" frame from a keybind or your actionbar, make a macro: @/click TourGuideItemFrame@

h2. Submitting bugs

For details on how to submit bugs, please read "this page":http://github.com/tekkub/TourGuide/blob/docs/submitting_bugs.markdown

h2. How to create (or edit) guides

TourGuide data files are fairly simple to create.
The simplest method is to copy an existing file and edit it how you want.
Please read "How to edit TourGuide guides":http://github.com/tekkub/TourGuide/blob/docs/writing_guides.markdown for help on the format and general guidelines.
I ask that all submissions follow these guidelines, to present a consistent format to the user.
I welcome all submissions, but reserve the right to edit them as I see fit, or reject ones that infringe upon other copyrighted guides.

See "this page":http://github.com/tekkub/TourGuide/blob/docs/submitting_bugs.markdown for details on how to fork my github repo to push your changes.
