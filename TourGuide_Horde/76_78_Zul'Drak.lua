To do this you will need to learn Gymer's controls pretty well as Navarius hits pretty hard sometimes. Ability 1 – This is your main attack and should be spammed almost constantly. Ability 2 – This is a very good knockback attack that will get multiple mobs off from beating on you while you fight bosses, and also does very good damage. Ability 3 – This is your most important ability, you will use this to snag up the storm clouds and heal yourself when your health begins to get low. Ability 4 – You can also use ability 3 to pick up a mob, then use this to throw the mob and it will explode and do damage. Once you have killed Navarius Thrym will spawn and you will have to fight him.  You will probably need to use a storm cloud to heal during each fight with the bosses.

Send it to attack Overlord Drakuru, spam every ability every single time it is available especially the heal and the stun. You will probably have your first Troll die on you partway through the fight, just wait until it dies then use the scepter and grab another one. During the fight Drakuru will throw blighted crystals at you, make sure you move away from the AoE damage. Eventually he will give up and a cinematic between him and the Lich King will play out and is pretty neat to watch. Once the Lich King kills him loot his skull to complete Betrayal.| |QID|12713|
