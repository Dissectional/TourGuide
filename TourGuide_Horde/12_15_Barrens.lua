N Ghostlands? |N|You may wish to level until 20 in Ghostlands instead of the Barrens.  There are some very nice rewards from Tranquillien for all classes.  If you wish to do this, fly to Undercity and port to Silvermoon, then run south to the Ghostlands.  Switch over to the Ghostlands guide, of course.|
